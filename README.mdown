FlipView Like FlipBoard
============================================================

If you have used the Flipboard app on iPad you would agree the magazine style layouts and flipping of pages is awesome. So, [we][] got inspired with this and created our own flip view application.

Note: this project is only for iPad.

Features currently implemented:

- Random layout selection

- Arranging view while changing orientation

- Page flip

- Multi-page flip

- Fullscreen view
